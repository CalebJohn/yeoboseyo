# 여보세요

let's the services say "hello" (여보세요 in Korean : `yeoboseyo`) to each others

This `hello` can be any data you want to get and send from any internet service to another

Services covered:

- [Joplin markdown editor](https://joplinapp.org)
- RSS Feeds
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social)
- [Reddit](https://reddit.com)

So today, you can read RSS Feeds and this will:
* create notes in Joplin automatically in the folder you defined in the form
* post "toot" to your mastodon account
* post stuff to the subreddit of your choice

## :package: Installation

create a virtualenv

```bash
python3.6 -m venv yeoboseyo
cd yeoboseyo
source bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##  :wrench: Settings
```bash
mv env.sample .env
```
set the correct values for your own environment
```ini
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
TIME_ZONE=Europe/Paris
JOPLIN_URL=http://127.0.0.1
JOPLIN_PORT=41184
JOPLIN_TOKEN=  # put the token you can find in the webclipper page of joplin editor
FORMAT_FROM=markdown_github
FORMAT_TO=html
BYPASS_BOZO=False   # if you don't want to get the malformed RSS Feeds set it to False
LOG_LEVEL=logging.INFO
MASTODON_USERNAME=  # your mastodon username
MASTODON_PASSWORD=  # your mastodon password
MASTODON_INSTANCE=https://mastodon.social  # your mastodon instance
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=   # see below explanation
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET= # see below explanation
REDDIT_PASSWORD=   # put your reddit password
REDDIT_USERAGENT=Yeoboseyo/1.0   # whatever :P
REDDIT_USERNAME=  #put your reddit login
```

## :dvd: Database

create the database (to execute only once)
```bash
python models.py
```

##  :shell: Mastodon Service
once your settings are ready run the following commands once

```bash
python mastodon_create_app.py
```
this will create an app named 'Yeoboseyo' with the username/pass you provided in the `.env` setting file .

this command will also create a file named `yeoboseyo_clientcred.secret` containing the token allowing us to publish stuff automatically.

##  :shell: Reddit service

you will need to declare an app from this page [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)

* enter th name of your app (eg "Yeoboseyo")
* select 'script'
* fill a description (eg "The bus for your internet services - an opensource alternative to IFTTT.com")
* about url : http://localhost
* redirect url : http://localhost/callback
then press create ; once it's done
in the frame you see the name "Yeoboseyo" under it "personal use script" and under it ; the precious REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, then the REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
Use those info to fill the `.env` file

## :mega: Running the Web application

```bash
cd yeoboseyo
